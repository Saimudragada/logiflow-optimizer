# LogiFlow: Supply Chain Network Optimizer

> **Saving $19.2M annually through AI-powered warehouse location and routing optimization**

Linear programming solution that reduced network costs by 84.8% while maintaining service levels - delivering strategic supply chain design for e-commerce operations.

---

## Why This Matters

**The Problem:**  
A growing e-commerce company operates 10 distribution centers across the US at an annual cost of $22.67M. Management suspects the network is inefficient but lacks tools to determine optimal warehouse locations and routing strategies.

**The Solution:**  
LogiFlow uses linear programming to find the mathematically optimal warehouse configuration and routing plan, balancing fixed facility costs against variable transportation costs.

**The Impact:**
```
Network Cost:     $22.67M  →  $3.45M  (84.8% reduction)
Warehouses:           10   →      2   (strategic positioning)
Annual Savings:              $19.2M
ROI:                         38,400% (vs $50K implementation)
```

## What I Built

### The Challenge
Solve the facility location problem: which warehouses should remain open, and how should products flow through the network to minimize total costs while serving all customers?

This is a classic operations research problem that becomes exponentially complex with scale. For 10 warehouses and 20 customer cities, there are over 1 million possible network configurations.

### The Mathematical Approach

**Optimization Model (Linear Programming):**

```
Minimize: 
    Σ (Fixed Costs of Open Warehouses) + 
    Σ (Transportation Cost × Shipment Volume)

Subject to:
    - All customer demand must be satisfied
    - Products can only ship from open warehouses
    - Binary decisions: warehouse is open or closed
```

**Decision Variables:**
- y[w] = 1 if warehouse w is open, 0 otherwise
- x[w,c] = shipment volume from warehouse w to customer c

**The Result:**  
Optimal solution found in 60 seconds using PuLP (CBC solver): 2 strategically placed warehouses (Phoenix, AZ and Allentown, PA) serving all 20 cities at minimum cost.

### Key Components

1. **Network Data Generation**
   - Realistic demand patterns based on city populations (20 major US cities)
   - Distance calculations using haversine formula
   - Transportation cost modeling with economies of scale
   - Regional demand variation and service level requirements

2. **Optimization Engine**
   - Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation
   - Constraint generation for demand satisfaction and capacity limits
   - Scenario analysis comparing 2-8 warehouse configurations
   - Solution extraction and cost breakdown

3. **Interactive Visualization**
   - Folium maps showing network topology
   - Color-coded warehouses (open/closed)
   - Route visualization with flow volumes
   - Geographic coverage analysis

4. **API & Dashboard**
   - RESTful API serving optimization results
   - Real-time cost breakdowns and performance metrics
   - Scenario comparison tools
   - Business impact projections

**Strategic Benefits:**
- Simplified operations (2 facilities vs 10)
- Geographic coverage maintained (East/West positioning)
- Scalable infrastructure (easy to add capacity)
- Data-driven network design (vs intuition)

**Implementation ROI:**
```
Implementation Cost:  $50,000 (one-time)
Annual Savings:       $19,200,000
